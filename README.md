# Soft apples suck
That's the issue.

I want to eat an apple, I choose one that looks good, I bite into it (after washing it of course), It's soft.
Day ruined.

after years of pain and agony from soft apples, I want to find a way to figure out if an apple is hard or soft.


# Current manual method

1. tap the apple with your fingernail
2. take another apple and also tap it with a fingernail
3. the apple that does not sound as hollow is the harder one

### Issues with this method:
It relies on other apples. If all of the apples are soft, then the hardest sounding apple will also be soft, which sucks.

This is not a joke (it is a bit)
I am dead serious about not wanting to eat soft apples again.
